			<Text>We owe you much, Right Honourable John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia! Before you were thrust into office, your country had suffered years upon years of crippling economic depression and governmental instability, and was faced with the outbreak of war in Europe and rising tensions in the Pacific. When Japanese aggression brought warfare to the nation's borders for the first time in its history, Australia was truly at its darkest hour. But under your leadership, Australia and her allies pushed their would-be invaders back from your shores! Thanks to your ingenious diplomatic and internal policies, Australia emerged from the war more united, more prosperous, and more assertive than ever. Though you tragically would not live to see it, your actions transformed the country into an independent and self-sufficient nation that thrives to this day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Prime Minister Curtin, dark clouds brew over Australia once more. The people clamour for your guiding hand to lead them through another time of great turmoil. Will you lead your island home onwards to peace and prosperity? Will you build a civilization to stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>For most of its history, the land known as "Australia" has been inhabited by various Aboriginal peoples, who were isolated from the rest of the world. Upon the European discovery of this vast landmass in 1606, many countries tried to take portions of it. Eventually, the British took the entire island of Australia, turning it into one of their most prosperous - and largest - colonies. Due to the vast amount of available land, the British Empire sent convicts to the territory, as a way of keeping the British Isles crime-free. Eventually, in 1901, Australia got its first Prime Minister, and eventually independence from Great Britain. As a newly-formed nation, Australia joined the First and Second World Wars, helping to put its place on the world map. Today, Australia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the world, as well as having strong economic and political links with other countries.</Text>

			<Text>Due to the large desert regions in Central Australia, the majority of the population live on the coast. Australia has several notable geographical features, such as Uluru, a sacred Aboriganal site; the Great Barrier Reef, off the north coast; and the Outback, a large, arid area in the middle of Australia. Due to the extreme heat in Australia's summer months, there are often bushfires which involve shrubs and plantlife being set on fire by the intense warming. These can cause a lot of trouble to Australians, and can be potentially deadly if not controlled properly.</Text>

			<Text>Before the 18th century, Australia was mostly inhabited by Aboriginals. They were probably originally from Asia, although they would not be classified as "Asian". About 50,000 years ago, there was a migration of these people to Australia, where they settled and lived in an isolated state for the next 49,700 or so years. The Aboriginals inhabited most of Australia, even some of the arid desert parts in the centre. However, most Aboriginals were located in the northern parts of the continent. Even today, there is still a small amount of these people, making up only 3% of Australia's total population. Most Aboriginals are now in the Northern Territory province of the country.</Text>

			<Text>The first outside sighting of Australia was made by a Dutch navigator called Willem Janszoon. On the 26th of February 1606, Janszoon landed at what is now Cape York, Queensland. He later went on to map 320 km of Australia's coastline, thinking it part of New Guinea. He named the land "Nieu Zeland", but the name didn't catch on. Over the course of that century, Dutch navigators charted the whole island, which they now named "New Holland", but never attempted to colonize. Over the next 200 years several voyages were made, but the most important was probably James Cook's expedition. Cook mapped the unknown South of Australia, which he called New South Wales. This was soon to grow into Britain's settlement on the island.</Text>

			<Text>With the loss of its 13 colonies in America in 1780, the British Empire sent a fleet to start colonizing Australia. On the 26th of January 1788 the British flag was raised at Sydney Cove, proclaiming the land a British settlement. Today, the 26th of January is celebrated as Australia Day. The site for this first colony later became Sydney. Eventually Britain split the island into several different colonial settlements, each with different governments, which today serve as regional divisions in Australia. They were used for different things by the British - most of them had some convict focus, except for South Australia, which was notably a "free colony".</Text>

			<Text>Australia was by this point a thriving British settlement, although it had no central government. The British eventually decided to use this vast land as a convict settlement by sending British prisoners to the mostly uninhabited land. From the start convicts had been used to establish initial colonies, but now there were larger prisons to house convicts in. Most of the time, the crimes they did were harmless - such as steal a loaf of bread - but all the same Britain used it as a convict settlement, perhaps to give people an even better reason not to commit crimes. The largest prison was Port Arthur in Tasmania, which was used for re-offending criminals.</Text>

The colonies' economies greatly benefited from this as it brought a lot of extra value to both the land and the amount of people in the settlements. While many people got massively rich off this, most of the people taking part in it didn't and instead took advantage of Australia's land laws and started farming.</Text>

			<Text>Early Life</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SENSHI_CURTIN_TEXT_2">
			<Text>John Curtin was born in Creswick, Victoria, on 8 January 1885. He was christened "John Joseph Ambrose", although his middle names were not recorded on his birth certificate and he stopped using them in later life. Within his family he was known as "Jack". The eldest of four children, his ancestry was Irish, with both of his parents being born in County Cork, Ireland. Curtin was born with congenital strabismus of the left eye, which remained noticeable throughout his life. It was largely a cosmetic defect, but he was quite self-conscious about it. According to his biographer David Day, it had "a considerable psychological effect" on him, and likely exacerbated his natural shyness. Curtin began his education at St Francis' Boys School, a Christian Brothers school attached to St Francis' Church. He later briefly attended St Bridget's School in Fitzroy. He also attended Macedon Primary School in Macedon. In 1894, Curtin and his family moved to Charlton, a small country town in north-west Victoria. His father had failed to prosper in Melbourne, which was in the middle of an economic downturn. In Charlton, he took over the lease of a pub owned by his brother-in-law, John Bourke. Curtin was enrolled in the local state school, as a Catholic school had not yet been established. He excelled academically, and was seen as a potential "scholarship boy". However, he and his family left Charlton in 1896. Struggling financially, they spent the following two years moving around country Victoria, as his father managed pubs in Dromana, Drouin, and Mount Macedon. Curtin attended the local state schools, ending his formal education in 1898 at the age of 13.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thus began Curtin’s working life. In early 1899, Curtin began working as an office boy at a weekly magazine called The Rambler, employed by the artist and writer Norman Lindsay whom Curtin knew through family. The magazine did not last long, and Curtin thus moved between short-term jobs, including as a copy boy at The Age, a potter's apprentice, and a houseboy at a gentlemen's club. His first permanent job was at age 18, taking up a position as an estimates clerk with the Titan Manufacturing Company in South Melbourne in September 1903. By that time he was the family's primary breadwinner, as his father was a virtual invalid. As a youth, Curtin was a talented sportsman. Between 1903 and 1907, he played as a half-forward flanker for the Brunswick Football Club in the semi-professional Victorian Football Association (VFA). His teammates gave him the nickname "Bumble". Curtin also played cricket for the Brunswick Cricket Club, where he had a reputation as a solid batsman. This passion for sports remained throughout his life, both as an administrator and supporter. He was said to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of cricket statistics.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SENSHI_CURTIN_TEXT_3">
			<Text>From a young age, Curtin was active in both the Australian Labor Party and the Victorian Socialist Party. A Marxist organisation, it was during this time that Curtin formed and held strong anti-imperialist and anti-militarist views. However, the view that led him to significantly differ with the mainstream of the Labor movement was an opposition to racism, which stemmed from his belief that racial hatred was used as a tool of the "exploiting class". This, however, was somewhat contradicted as Prime Minister, where he defended the White Australia Policy. He wrote for radical and socialist newspapers, and from 1911 to 1915 Curtin was employed as state secretary of the Timberworkers' Union. He was elected federal president of the union in 1914. During World War I he was a militant anti-conscriptionist, differing from then Labor (or at least, at the time) Prime Minister Billy Hughes; he was briefly imprisoned in December 1916 for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination, even though he knew he would fail the exam due to his very poor eyesight. Makes you wonder how he was such a good batsmen, huh?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1914 he also stood (unsuccessfully) as the Labor candidate for Balaclava in the 1914 federal election. The wartime period led to a large strain upon Curtin, where he began to drink heavily and regularly, a vice which blighted his career for many years. It was not all crippling, though, and it was at this time he proposed to Elsie Needham, the sister of Labor Senator Ted Needham, on St Kilda Beach, after which and they were married on 21 April 1917. Curtin was introduced to Elsie Needham on a visit to Tasmania in April 1912, Fred Katz, an acquaintance from the Victorian Socialist Party, had taken Curtin to visit Elsie's father Abraham Needham, a candidate in the 1912 Tasmanian state election. Together, they had two children, creatively named Elsie and John.</Text>

			<Text>Later in 1917, Curtin moved to Perth in Western Australia to become an editor for the Westralian Worker, the official trade union newspaper. He settled in the suburb of Cottesloe where his residence is now heritage-listed as "John Curtin's House". He enjoyed the less pressured life of Western Australia, and it was here that his political views gradually moderated, shifting from a more radical Marxist to a more typical trade unionist. He joined the Australian Journalists' Association (AJA) in 1917 and was elected its Western Australian President in 1920. So proud of his heritage in this was Curtin that he wore his AJA badge (WA membership #56) every day he was prime minister.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Curtin stood for Parliament a second time in 1925, this time for Fremantle, although he lost heavily to the incumbent William Watson. Watson retired in 1928, and Curtin ran again, this time winning on the second count. Re-elected in Labor's sweeping election victory the following year, he expected to be named as a member of Prime Minister James Scullin's Cabinet, but disapproval of his heavy drinking habit meant that he remained on the backbench. William Watson chose to briefly come out of retirement in 1931 after joining the United Australia Party, and easily defeated Curtin in an election that saw Labor collapse to just 14 seats in Parliament. After the loss, Curtin became the advocate for the Western Australian Government with the Commonwealth Grants Commission. He stood for his old seat in 1934 after Watson announced his retirement for the second time, and was able to win it back.

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIVILOPEDIA_LEADERS_SENSHI_CURTIN_TEXT_5">
			<Text>When James Scullin resigned as Labor Leader in 1935, Curtin stood in the election to replace him, although he was not expected to win. Two others nominated themselves to stand for the party leadership - Frank Forde and Norman Makin. Scullin had suffered persistent ill health for several years, and thus, many were aware that Frank Forde was being groomed for leadership after Scullin, and was seen as his natural successor. On the first ballot of the caucus vote, of the 21 votes, 9 went to Curtin, 10 to Forde and 2 to Makin. Thus eliminating Makin, the two votes switched to Curtin, making him the leader of the opposition by 1 vote. Curtin was the first leader of a major political party to represent a constituency in Western Australia. Forde's association with the Scullin Government and support of the Premiers' Plan were believed to have played against him, as left wing factions and trade unions had opposed some of the economic policies of Scullin’s era. . The groups that had supported Curtin did so on the basis that he promise to give up alcohol, which he subsequently did. Although Labor made little progress at the 1937 election, by 1939 Labor's position had vastly improved. Curtin led Labor to a five-seat swing in the 1940 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. In that election, Curtin's own seat of Fremantle had been in doubt. United Australia Party challenger Frederick Lee appeared to have won the seat on the second count after most of independent Guildford Clarke's preferences flowed to him, and it was not until the final counting of preferential votes that Curtin knew he had won the seat.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was also as Opposition Leader that World War II broke out. In line with the king's declaration of war, Prime Minister Robert Menzies declared war on Germany and announced Australia's support for the British war effort. In 1941, Menzies travelled to Britain to discuss Australia's role in the war strategy, and to express concern at the reliability of Singapore's defences, only to be drawn into Winston Churchill's disastrous Greek campaign, as Menzies was generally more than a little sympathetic to "the mother country". While he was in Britain, Menzies lost the support of his own party, and was forced to resign as prime minister. The Coalition elected Arthur Fadden, the leader of the Country Party, as Menzies' replacement, even though the UAP was the senior partner in the Coalition. Curtin adroitly refused calls from his own caucus to bring about the defeat of the government through a motion of no confidence.</Text>

			<Text>Curtin had refused Menzies' initial offer to form a wartime "national government", partly because he feared that it would split the Labor Party, although he did agree to join the Advisory War Council. In October 1941, Arthur Coles and Alexander Wilson, the two independent MPs who had been keeping the Coalition in office since 1940 (first under Menzies, then under Fadden), joined forces with Labor in defeating Fadden's budget and bringing the government down. Governor-General Lord Gowrie was reluctant to call an election for a Parliament barely a year old, especially given the international situation. He summoned Coles and Wilson and made them promise that if he named Curtin prime minister, they would support him for the remainder of the Parliament to end the instability in government. The independents agreed, and Curtin was sworn in as prime minister on 7 October, aged 56. He became the first and only prime minister to come from Western Australia. Curtin had barely been in office 2 months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on the 8th December, beginning the Pacific theatre of the War. Curtin addressed the nation, stating that Australia was at war with Japan in his classic rough Australian accent: "Men and women of Australia...we are at war with Japan. This is the gravest hour of our history. We Australians have imperishable traditions. We shall maintain them. We shall vindicate them. We shall hold this country and keep it as a citadel for the British-speaking race and as a place where civilisation will persist".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perhaps one of the most fateful policies during this time was Curtin seeking assistance from the United States, thus trying himself to them. Fear about the foe facing Japan led Curtin to declare on his New Year’s Message (which happened on Boxing Day): "The Australian Government, therefore regards the Pacific struggle as primarily one in which the United States and Australia must have the fullest say in the direction of the Democracies' fighting plan. Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom". Many felt that Prime Minister Curtin was abandoning Australia's traditional ties to the British Isles without any solid partnership in place with the United States. This speech also received criticism at high levels of government in Australia, Britain and the US; it angered Churchill, and Roosevelt said that it "smacked of panic", though when evaluated in the context of other World War II speeches, especially by Churchill under threat of Nazi invasion, one would realise this was not necessarily the case. By 1943, when the threat of Japanese invasion had passed, Curtin increasingly returned to a commitment to the British Empire. Downplaying nationalism, he said that Australia comprised "seven million Britishers". He saw the United States as a predatory economic and military power that would threaten Australia's own ambitions in the Pacific. Australia moved closer to New Zealand, and suggested a lesser role for the United States after the war. Concurrently, the Curtin government enacted the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942, under which Australia accepted the dominion status which Britain had conferred in 1930, but which the Australian federal government had not accepted until then. The Adoption Act took effect retroactively as of 3 September 1939, the outbreak of World War II. Although politically a product of the government's policy of re-orientation towards the United States, constitutionally, this marked the moment that Australia became an independent nation with a separate Crown, no longer subject to the supremacy of British law and the British Crown.</Text>

			<Text>The Curtin Government agreed that the Australian Army's I Corps – centred on the 6th and 7th Divisions – would be transferred from North Africa to the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command in the Netherlands East Indies for the defence of Java and Sumatra. Before they could arrive, Singapore fell on 15 February 1942. Most of the 8th Division was taken into captivity, although a small number, including its commander, Major General Gordon Bennett, managed to escape. "The fall of Singapore," Curtin announced in a radio address to the nation on 16 February, "can only be described as Australia's Dunkirk. It will be recalled that the fall of Dunkirk initiated the Battle for Britain. The fall of Singapore opens the Battle for Australia. On its issue depends not merely the fate of this Commonwealth but the frontier of the United States of America and, indeed, all the Americas and, therefore, in a large measure the fate of the British-speaking world." The Japanese threat was further underlined on 19 February, when Japan bombed Darwin, the first of many air raids on northern Australia. These air raids proved mentally scarring for Australia, who had thus far only contended with the idea of invasion, and who had a natural island fortress to protect itself. At this time, Churchill attempted to divert I Corps to reinforce British troops in Burma, without Australian approval. Curtin insisted that it return to Australia, as the bombing of Japan had realised some Australian fears and exacerbated others. Roosevelt supported Churchill, offering to send an American division to Australia instead, while the Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, threaten to resign if his advice was ignored and the troops were diverted to Burma. Curtin prevailed, although he agreed that the main body of the 6th Division could garrison Ceylon.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Curtin formed a close working relationship with the Allied Supreme Commander in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur. Curtin realised that Australia would be ignored unless it had a strong voice in Washington, D.C., and he wanted that voice to be MacArthur's. He gave over control of Australian forces to MacArthur, directing Australian commanders to treat MacArthur's orders as if they came from the Australian Government. By mid-1942, the results of the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway had averted the perceived threat of invasion. Curtin had previously opposed conscription for overseas service during World War I, and again in 1940 when it was introduced by Menzies, although he had supported softening it to allow conscripts to serve in Australian territories. Curtin recognised that the restriction of the Australian conscripts to Australia and its territories was politically unviable, and thus, the Defence Act was amended so that conscripts could be deployed outside of Australia to "such other territories in the South-West Pacific Area as the Governor-General proclaims as being territories associated with the defence of Australia". The stress of the war and especially this bitter internal battle within Labor over conscription, which had waged between the Communists and sympathising factions, and those factions who were driven by their Catholic faith, took a great toll on Curtin's health, which had never been robust even at the best of times. He had suffered all of his life from stress-related illnesses, suffering from depression and being a heavy smoker.</Text>

			<Text>Curtin made very heavy use of newspapers and broadcast media, especially through press conferences, speeches, and newsreels. Australians gained a sense it was a people's war in which they were full participants. In terms of social policy, the Curtin Government enacted a wide range of progressive social reforms during its time in office. Pensions were introduced for deserted wives and widows, while the establishment of the Women's Employment Board led to increased wages for some women during the war. Aboriginal Australians were provided with significantly increased entitlement to welfare benefits, while maternity allowances were extended. In addition, pensions for the elderly and infirm were increased. And unlike the United Kingdom, Australia at this time continued their elections. Thus, in 1943, Curtin had to contend with election season. He did, however, enter in a strong position. Even allowing for the advantages that an incumbent government has in wartime, Fadden and Hughes had been unable to get the better of Curtin, and the Coalition had become almost moribund. In the election, Curtin led Labor to its greatest-ever victory, winning two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives on a two-party preferred vote of 58.2% and a 17-seat swing. The Coalition was reduced to only 19 seats nationwide, including only one west of Broken Hill. Fadden's Country Party took a particularly severe beating, winning only seven seats. Labor also won the primary vote in all states in the Senate, and thus all 19 seats, to hold a majority of 22 out of 36 seats. Buoyed by this success, Curtin called a referendum which would give the government control of the economy and resources for five years after the war was over. The 1944 Australian Referendum contained one referendum question: "Do you approve of the proposed law for the alteration of the Constitution entitled 'Constitution Alteration (Post-War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights) 1944'?" This referendum, which gave Curtin a wide mandate, failed by roughly 54% to 46%.</Text>

			<Text>By 1944, a time when he was travelling to and from London and Washington for meetings with Churchill, Roosevelt and other Allied leaders, Curtin had already developed heart disease. He had a heart attack in November 1944, and did not return to work until January 1945. With the end of the war in sight, his health began to deteriorate seriously and at a rapid pace. On 5 July 1945, Curtin died at The Lodge at the age of 60, proving it is possible to die from something other than boredom in Canberra. He was the second Australian prime minister to die in office within six years. A Catholic priest called at The Lodge as Curtin lay dying, but he was turned away. Curtin had refused to so much as set foot inside a Catholic church throughout his adult life, not even to attend the weddings of friends. His body was returned to Perth on a RAAF Dakota escorted by a flight of nine fighter aircraft. After lying in state, he was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth; the service was attended by over 30,000 at the cemetery with many more lining the streets. Curtin was initially succeeded as prime minister by his deputy, Frank Forde; but seven days later a party ballot installed Ben Chifley as Labor Leader and therefore prime minister. Many of Curtin's post-war reconstruction plans were implemented by Chifley.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was under Curtin that the welfare state was truly set into motion. It was under Curtin Australia was defended, and under Curtin that uniform taxation was introduced, continuing the consolidation of power by the federal government. His early death and the sentiments it aroused have given Curtin a unique place in Australian political history. Successive Labor leaders, particularly Bob Hawke and Kim Beazley, have sought to build on the Curtin tradition of "patriotic Laborism". Even some political conservatives pay at least formal homage to the Curtin legend. Curtin is commemorated with a number of monuments to him, with the federal seat of Curtin, the Canberra suburb of Curtin, Curtin University in Perth, John Curtin College of the Arts in Fremantle, the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra, the John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library, and Curtin Springs in the Northern Territory being among the hundreds of commemorations for him.</Text>

			<Text>The CAC Boomerang was a fighter aircraft designed, and accordingly manufactured in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation between 1942 and 1945. These planes were approved for production shortly before the entry of Japan into World War II. Previously, on 17 October 1936, with the encouragement of the Government of Australia, three companies came together to form a joint venture, registered as the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC), which had the goal of assessing the viability of the development of a self-sufficient aircraft industry after observing the political moves of the German Reich under Adolf Hitler and the Empire of Japan to arm themselves militarily. The Boomerang’s were designed rapidly to meet the increased need by the RAAF. The first aircraft combat designed and constructed in Australia, a number of different variants were eventually constructed a series of corresponding production contract numbers CA-12, CA-13, CA-14 and CA-19. These variants would have a number of modifications.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Boomerang was handicapped by the available engine variant, which gave low power at altitude and resulted in the aircraft proving to be slower than contemporary fighter aircraft. The Boomerang rarely engaged in aerial combat. During early wartime operations, the Boomerang was mainly dispatched to equip home-based squadrons, freeing up other fighters for use overseas. In later service, the Boomerang would commonly be used for ground support duties, cooperating with Allied army units, in addition to secondary roles such as aerial reconnaissance and air sea rescue.</Text>

			<Text>At the beginning of the Second World War, the Australian Army did not possess any "special forces" units. Late in 1940, the British government sent a military mission to Australia, headed by Lieutenant-Colonel J.C Mawhood, to investigate the possibility of establishing a number of such units within the Australian Army. The British proposed the establishment of independent companies that would receive special training in order to take part in combined operations and various other tasks, including "...raids, demolitions, sabotage, subversion and organising civil resistance". This was a very broad notion of the role that the independent companies would play, and there was considerable confusion over how these units would be used; for a while, this uncertainty threatened the very existence of the independent company concept. Acting on British advice, the Australian Army began raising and training the 2/1st Independent Company in March 1941. Formed from volunteers from all branches of the Australian military, they were initially modelled upon the British Army Commandos and began training at the 7th Infantry Training Centre, Guerrilla Warfare School, at Wilson's Promontory, Victoria. In December 1941, with Japan's entry into the war, problems with the concept and the training course were ironed out, and more independent companies were raised, until there were eight in tota, including 1st Independent Company and New Guinea Air Warning Wireless (Independent) Company. Initially the independent companies were raised to serve alongside the Second Australian Imperial Force (Second AIF) in the Middle East; however, as the threat from Japan developed it was decided to use them in the Pacific theatre, in the islands to the north of Australia where it was necessary to establish outposts to warn of the approach of Japanese forces. Their mission would then be to remain behind and harass the invading Japanese forces. In 1943, the Independent Companies were re-organised into commando units and other adjacent units, including Z unit. Modern Australian commando units are the legacy of these Independent Companies.</Text>
