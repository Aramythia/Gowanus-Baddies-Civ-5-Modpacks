    Text for diplomatic responses from the vanilla game. This version of the diplomacy text uses general entries like "DECLINE" and "HUMAN_RESPONSE BAD" for some of the responses to questions, like the original text does.
	
	This initial comment (and all others) can be deleted when you use this template for your own mod.

	When using this, replace every instance of "NAME_NAME" with your leader's internal type (from the Leaders table).
	
	There can be multiple responses for each response type, by adding a numbered suffix. For example, to add another first greeting, add a second entry with the tag "TXT_KEY_LEADER_ZHONGLI_FIRSTGREETING_2".
	
	"&apos;" can be used to insert an apostrophe. I'm not sure it's required to do it this way, but if you have trouble making apostrophes appear, try using it.
    
	Lines that, by default, have placeholders for variable text will have those placeholders in a comment after the text tags. The placeholders are named to indicate what will replace them. What the game replaces the placeholders with is hardcoded, so changing "{1_CivName}" to "{1_PlayerName}", for example, will have no effect.
	
	Template originally based off of the Diplomacy XML in the Touhou - Eientei mod by Paul "Huitzil"  Durant, with additions from the Hidamari mod
