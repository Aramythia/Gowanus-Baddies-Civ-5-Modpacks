			<Text>The Woodland Realm was a kingdom of Silvan Elves in the Forest of the Wilderland beginning in the Second Age. The Elves of the Woodland Realm, unlike many Elves, were known to be less wise and more dangerous, but were nevertheless one of the most powerful and legendary of the Elves of Middle-earth.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thranduil, son of Oropher, was an Elven king who ruled over the Woodland Realm in the Second and Third Ages. Though inherently cautious, he eventually committed his kingdom to fighting Sauron in the War of the Ring. He was also the father of the elven prince of Mirkwood, Legolas, who was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] At the beginning of Thranduil's reign his kingdom encompassed all of Greenwood the Great and was known as the Woodland Realm, but as the Third Age progressed, the shadow of the Necromancer advanced, the Greenwood grew dark and became known as Mirkwood, and became infested with orcs and giant spiders. The Wood-elves of Mirkwood were reduced in number and retreated to lands in the north of Mirkwood.  By the time of the events of The Lord of the Rings Thranduil's title was King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] The Silvan Elves are behind you Thranduil, King of the Woodland Realm. Will you sit idly in the woods and let the wars of others come to their conclusions without you? Or will you march to them and return victorious? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>Lead by Thranduil, these Mirkwood Archers are often times referred to as Wood Elves even though Elves from Lorien also are. With their large bows they are able to unleash powerful arrows into their enemies, and it is often rumored that these fine men can blend into the forest allowing them to use stealth against their enemies. Legolas was the most renowned archer throughout the Third Age. Earlier in his journey with the Fellowship of the Ring, he used a bow from Mirkwood and it was later replaced by the bow of the Galadhrim Lady Galadriel gave him.</Text>

			<Text>Entmoot was a gathering or meeting of Ents. An Entmoot didn't happen very often. In Fangorn Forest they were always held in Derndingle, a bowl-like valley far south of Treebeard's home. Since the Ents' language was so descriptive and "unhasty", an Entmoot could take a very long time. The Entmoot in The Lord of the Rings was held from February 30 to March 2, 3019 to decide whether the Ents should go to war against Saruman; it lasted from noon on the first day till afternoon on the third day, which was considered quick for an Entmoot. Meriadoc Brandybuck (Merry) and Peregrin Took (Pippin) were present at that Entmoot, staying with the "hasty" Ent Quickbeam.</Text>
