				Saruman the White was an Istari, or wizard, who lived in Middle-earth during the Third Age. Originally, he was the chief of the wizards and of the White Council that opposed Sauron. His extensive studies of dark magic, however, eventually led him to desire the One Ring for himself. Thinking he could ally himself with Sauron and then betray him, Saruman allied Isengard with Mordor in the War of the Ring. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Saruman was the first of the five Wizards to arrive in Middle-earth. He was said to be the eldest of the order, and Gandalf acknowledged him as the chief of the Istari. Many feared the White Wizard and his compelling voice; even Sauron himself. His dwelling was the fortress of Orthanc in Isengard, below Methedras. He studied deeply the arts of Sauron to oppose him, but he soon became enamored of Sauron's devices, especially the One Ring. He betrayed his mission, and sought the power of the Ring for himself. He initially advocated an alliance with Sauron, but he soon betrayed Sauron as well, as his ultimate goal was to supplant Sauron and rule Middle-earth. But his plans came to nought, and his power was broken in the Battle of the Hornburg and the Battle of Isengard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Saruman, the time has come to rebuild the armies of Isengard. Will you be defeated again? Or can you end victorious with what you have learned from the War of the Ring? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

			<Text>Isengard was built in the Second Age around the tower of Orthanc by the NÃºmenoreans-in-exile in the days of their power in Nan Curunir (valley at the end of the Misty Mountains). Its location was at the northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together with the fortress of Helm's Deep to its south protected the Gap of Rohan. Isengard consisted of a circular stone-wall surrounding a broad plain, in the center of which was the Tower of Orthanc. Isengard had only one gate, which faced south. The river Angren (or Isen) began at Methedras behind Isengard, which also formed its northern wall. The other three sides were guarded by a large wall, known as the Ring of Isengard, which was only breached by the inflow of the river Angren at the northeast through a portcullis, and the gate of Isengard at the south, at both shores of the river.</Text>

			<Text>Tolkien described Uruk-hai as black skinned, with slanted eyes. They were armed with bows made of yew, short-swords and spears. Some had iron collars. Given that "Orc-man" and "Men-orcs", Half-orcs are treated as distinct types of hybrids, and that "Orc-men" is differentiated from Uruk-hai in Unfinished Tales, some then assume that the "Man-orcs large and cunning" are the Uruk-hai, at least those of Saruman. However, there is nothing in the quotation itself that states that the term "Man-orcs" specifically applies to Uruk-hai.</Text>

			<Text>In order to raise their ladders more quickly and secure them against a fortress wall, the Uruk-hai employ a unique engine of war that hurls a massive grapple at the foes' battlements. Of course, other uses have been found for such a weapon and it will often be found in support of an Uruk-hai army where its looming presence will strike fear into the heart of the enemy. If such a powerful weapon can damage castle walls, what chance of survival does a mere man have?</Text>
