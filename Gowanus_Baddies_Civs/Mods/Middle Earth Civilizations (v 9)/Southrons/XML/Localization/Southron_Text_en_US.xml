				Haradrim, also called the Southrons, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of Middle-earth directly south of Gondor. At the time of the War of the Ring, the Southrons were in league with Sauron and fought alongside his orc army, riding atop gigantic, elephant-like Mûmakil. Once Sauron was destroyed, the Southrons joined forces with the Easterlings and Variags and their Kings started war on King Elessar, as well as off-continent enemies from since before the First Age. For many years, the Haradrim were the greatest enemy of Gondor. Several times, they invaded the north. Finally, the Men of Gondor were able to capture Harad, though it was later freed. During the War of the Ring the Haradrim were allied with Sauron. A Haradrim warrior wounded Faramir. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields the 18,000 Haradrim, mostly mounted on the mumakil, were a great threat to the Rohirrim that had come to aid the people of Minas Tirith. At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields a chieftain, bearing the standard of a black serpent on a scarlet field, led the Haradrim cavalry. King Théoden of Rohan slew this Haradrim leader in single combat.  [NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Suladan, the Serpent Lord, your men are ready. Will the Haradrim you able to muster up enough forces to vanquish your foes? Or will you be defeated by an army of the dead? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>
