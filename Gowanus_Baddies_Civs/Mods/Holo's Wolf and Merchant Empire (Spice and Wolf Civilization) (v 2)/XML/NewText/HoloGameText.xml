			<Text>The Wolves of Yoitsu were great beings which called the snowy forest of Yoitsu their home. Many were revered as Gods to various villages and towns, and most took great pride in their responsibility to protecting the humans in their presence. While the Wisewolf, Holo, embarked on a journey across distant lands seeking companionship, Yoitsu had met with calamity. The destructive being known as the Moon-Hunting Bear descended on the village of Yoitsu, and as the legends tell of it, Yoitsu was destroyed without so much as a fight. It is yet unclear what the fate of the Wolves, who once called Yoitsu their home, has become.</Text>

			<Text>O prideful Holo, great Wisewolf of Yoitsu, though your journeys have finally afforded you some measure of peace and happiness with the one you love, the people of the world once again seek your guidance. Frought with mistakes, history has become a cruel mistress. The world is in turmoil, with conflict spread far across the land. Thieves and mercenary bands now roam the land plundering and pillaging wherever they go. Attacking hapless merchants and civilians alike, they are little more than barbarians. Have the very Gods whom the humans so diligently prayed to forsaken them in the end?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Holo, the people seek not salvation, but your wisdom and kindness which knows no bounds. Your experience and leadership may bring peace to this chaotic world. Your partner, Lawrence, has offered to assist you with his wealth of merchant contacts and his old Trade Guild. He will do all he can to support you from the shadows -- a merchant's natural battlefield.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]O Holo, your wisdom and pride are matched only by the magnificence of your tail. With your lover by your side and all of his abilities at hand, will you once again take up the mantle of responsibility for the sake of the ones who so desperately cry out for you in this dark time? Will you be clever enough to stand on the world's stage with -- or against -- other leaders, in order to build the greatest merchant empire the world has ever seen? Will you be able to bring order back to the world so that you may enjoy your days in tranquility? Can you build a civilization that will stand the test of time?</Text>

Great Wolves are an excellent, and dramatic, mid-game front-line unit, able to hold their own against most other enemies of its time, and are still great at scouting for exposed flanks.
