This is a fan-made custom/fictional Civilization modification for Civlization V.
Over 7 months of work and love went into creating this because I loved the story of Spice and Wolf, and I hope everyone who plays it enjoys it as much as I did.
While virtually all of the coding and art assets were done solely by me, I would not have gotten this far without the help and moral support of many different people along the way.

With that, I would like to give my special thanks to:

Vice Virtuoso
	- Inspiring me to try my hand at creating a fictional Civ with his Madoka and other related anime Civs
	- Helping me get started by teaching me the basics of XML and Lua
	- Many bits of help and support over the months of development

BouncyMischa
	- More Touhou Civs to convince me that fictional Civs could work in such a game, if creative enough
	- One of the earliest supporters giving me help and guidance toward how to get started with modding
	- Teaching me my first Lua function, paving the way for my ludicrous 1500+ line Lua script
	- Much support throughout the development process
	- Pushing for inclusion of the Apple Orchards

LeeS
	- Being extremely eager to help start me off with the XML
	- Creating the absolute godsend of all XML building guides
	- Continuous support throughout the development process

whoward69
	- Basically a Firaxis developer, pointing the way forward when I was lost, with all of his knowledge
	- Providing use of his Plot Iterators Lua script

Pazyryk
	- Teaching me about Lua tables and such
	- Providing use of his TableSaverLoader Lua script

KyteM
	- Providing use of his Dynamic Culture Overview windows

Wyzcrak
	- For his patience in teaching me more advanced Lua as development went on

Rarimi
	- Major play tester, providing a wealth of invaluable support and feedback, despite having his own version of the Civ
	- Pushing for inclusion of the Wolf units

KIdanor
	- Major play tester, providing a ridiculous amount of support, play time, and feedback and suggestions (even if most were shot down)

Isuna Hasekura
	- For providing us with the story of Spice and Wolf, there literally would not be such a Civ without him

Playtesters, CFC
	- All of the various play testers that have come and gone during the past months, and all of the users of the CivFanatics Community for all of their wealth of information

Wolf Models were an interesting addition, and required several people to make happen:
Civitar
	- For providing his original "reskinnable" Wolf pack, itself a mesh of Deliverator and Kwadjh's offerings

Nutty
	- For the expert technical assistance that found issues with Civitar's files, explaining the issues I ran into trying to implement them

Nomad or What
	- For his expertise in actually going ahead and fixing/re-importing the files properly, providing a working pack of Wolf unit models

I have fixed up all of the Wolves in Civitar's pack in accordance with Nomad or What's fixes, as well as organized them more coherently.
The Great Wolf unit skin in use is a custom retexture by me, using Civitar's reskinnable set.

Apple Orchard:
Horem
	- For making available the Apple Orchard/Plantation improvement models

The Apple Orchard's trees have been retextured by me for, in my eyes, more pleasing colors.
