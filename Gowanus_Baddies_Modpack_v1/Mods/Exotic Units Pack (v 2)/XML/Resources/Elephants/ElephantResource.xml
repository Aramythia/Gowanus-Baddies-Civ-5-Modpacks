				Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. Three species are currently recognized: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheres, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Historically, elephants were considered formidable instruments of war. They were equipped with armor to protect their sides, and their tusks were given sharp points of iron or brass if they were large enough. War elephants were trained to grasp an enemy soldier and toss him to the person riding on them or to pin the soldier to the ground and impale him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One of the earliest references to war elephants is in the Indian epic Mahabharata, written in the 4th century BC, but said to describe events between the 11th and 8th centuries BC. They were not used as much as horse-drawn chariots by either the Pandavas or Kauravas. During the Magadha Kingdom, 6th century BC, elephants began to achieve greater cultural importance than horses, and later Indian kingdoms used war elephants extensively; 3,000 of them were used in the Nandas in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, army while 9,000 may have been used in the Mauryan army between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC. The Arthashastra, written around 300 BC, advised the Mauryan government to reserve some forests for wild elephants for use in the army, and to execute anyone who killed them. From South Asia, the use of elephants in warfare spread west to Persia and east to Southeast Asia. The Persians used them during the Achaemenid Empire between the 6th and 4th centuries BC, while Southeast Asian states first used war elephants possibly as early as the 5th century BC and continued to the 20th century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Alexander the Great trained his foot soldiers to injure the animals and cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, who was one of Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt, beginning in 323 BC. His son and successor Ptolemy II obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used elephants in his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.
